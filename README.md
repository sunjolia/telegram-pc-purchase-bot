# telegram-pc-purchase-bot

Chat bot created to familiarize myself with the telebot API for Telegram. 
Intended to help users through purchasing a PC while educating them about the parts of a PC. 
Hardcoded responses for now simply to understand the API. Eventual goal is to tailor bot
language according to knowledge level/intrigue of user. Further interest includes migrating to a
different chat platform for testing. This was originally created for Hackathon GUL at
Universidad de Carlos III Madrid. Our conceptual design pitch won 1st place.
